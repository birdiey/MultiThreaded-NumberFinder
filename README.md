# MultiThreaded-NumberFinder

## Description
This Java application demonstrates multi-threading by simulating a number-guessing game. Multiple threads attempt to find a randomly generated number, and the first thread to match the number wins.

## Features
- **Multi-threading**: Utilizes multiple threads for concurrent number guessing.
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates random numbers for threads to guess.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Uses shared resources (`NumGenerated`) to coordinate between threads.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/birdiey/MultiThreaded-NumberFinder.git
